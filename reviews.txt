Things to do:

Code:
- reorganize the readme files (perhaps keep only 1 single file with sections).
- save figure for all plotting code
- (done) Remove AWS instructions before publishing
- (done) I suggest the authors change all commands to "python3"
- (done) The requirements.txt is mentioned here. Please make it clear in the steps provided in the readme file.
- (done) I suggest the authors move this package installation requirement into the preparation phase.
- (done) I suggest the authors add "mkdir plots" before the reproducing commands.
- (done) When generating new results for reproducing Fig.9, I received the following error.
- (no need) Please fix the mkdir for the *experiment_results_new/* folder. It created *experiment_results/new/* for me in the first run for some reason.

"""
- (done) Some folders needed to be manually created before running the experiments. Please automate that as part of the scripts. 
- (done) I suggest the authors add "import os" to the beginning of "plot_KL_netsize.py".
- (done) In `Figs. 13-15`, the command will return error, ‘/’ has to be added at the end of the path.

Appendix:
- In section B, please fix it to Python3 for the software requirements.
- in the `Experiment (E1)`, `[Results]` part, adding the instruction to look for `README.md` in the `python` folder would be nice, etc.

Low priority:
- I suggest adding brief descriptions for the parameters of the functions as well.
- Test Fig. 8

Not doing:
- The steps involved in reproducing Fig. 6 are a little complicated, e.g., edit source code, recompile, and re-execute. In `Fig. 6`, directly editing go.mod and executing `make install` doesn't work in clean environment.

Reproduced badge

3. Yes

Summary of the artifact
-----------------------
The artifact includes measurement experiments for the censorship attack and its detection/mitigation on IPFS network. There are multiple settings (e.g., number of Sybils) for the experiments. Results regarding success rates are measured for each setting.

Comments for authors
--------------------
The authors provided clear instructions on how to reproduce the results and what they mean. I appreciate the authors giving us access to a prepared EC2 instance for testing. I think the artifact overall satisfied the requirements.

Appendix: it is good that the software dependencies in section A mention Python 3 version. However, please make it consistent in other places. In section B, please fix it to Python3 for the software requirements. The requirements.txt is mentioned here. Please make it clear in the steps provided in the readme file.

Some folders needed to be manually created before running the experiments. Please automate that as part of the scripts. 

Please fix the mkdir for the *experiment_results_new/* folder. It created *experiment_results/new/* for me in the first run for some reason.

Sourcecode is well-documented overall. I suggest adding brief descriptions for the parameters of the functions as well.

One suggestion for helping reproduction is to reorganize the readme files (perhaps keep only 1 single file with sections). Currently, there are multiple readme (in the submission and on the given EC2 instance), and they contain some different instructions that could be confusing.

Summary of the artifact
-----------------------
Overall, the instructions (README) provided by the authors are clear and easy to follow. Most of the figures presented in the paper can be reproduced. However, the README needs to be further improved.

Comments for authors
--------------------
Thanks for submitting the artifacts for evaluation. I used the authors' AWS instance to do the evaluation. Overall, the instructions provided in the README files are clear and easy to follow, and most of the figures can be reproduced. However, during the evaluation process, I noted several issues in the README file. I hope it may help the authors further improve the artifacts.

1. There are inconsistent uses of "python" commands (some are "python", some are "python3"). Since "python" is not installed on the AWS instance. I suggest the authors change all commands to "python3".

2. The steps involved in reproducing Fig. 6 are a little complicated, e.g., edit source code, recompile, and re-execute. It will be more convenient for evaluators if different versions of the source code are provided in the artifacts.

3. When generating new results for reproducing Fig.9, I received the following error.
"""
$ go run measureGenerateSybilKeys rsa > timing rsa.csv
github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-kad-dht@v0.18.0 (replaced by ../../common/go-libp2p-kad-dht): reading ../../common/go-libp2p-kad-dht/go.mod: open /home/ubuntu/common/go-libp2p-kad-dht/go.mod: no such file or directory
"""

Then using "python3 plot_key_generation_time.py" to reproduce Fig.9 with the authors' result throws a new error of "ModuleNotFoundError". This is solved by "python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt". I suggest the authors move this package installation requirement into the preparation phase.

In addition, when running the above python command, it throws an error of "No such file or directory: ./plots/". I suggest the authors add "mkdir plots" before the reproducing commands.

4. When following the README to run "python3 plot_prob_dist.py", since '--output' is not specified, no plots will be generated. I suggest the authors add '--output' to the command.

5. When following the README to run "python3 plot_KL_netsize.py --output "KLs_netsize.pdf"", I received the following error:
NameError: name 'os' is not defined.

I suggest the authors add "import os" to the beginning of "plot_KL_netsize.py".

Summary of the artifact
-----------------------
This artifact implements a censorship attack on the IPFS network, the corresponding detection, and mitigation methods. The implementation and the scripts for the experiments described in the paper are provided.
Four major claims are made on the effectiveness of the proposed attack and mitigation method.

Comments for authors
--------------------
Thank you authors for participating in the AE process.

### Badges

I will go through the reasons why I assign or do not assign each badge below:

#### Available badge - assigned

The artifact is not publicly available right now. However, in the `APPENDIX A`, `A. Description & Requirements` section, the authors have committed to uploading their materials when the mitigation schemes are deployed in production environment. Thus, the Available badge is assigned.

#### Functional badge - assigned

The artifact has all the scripts and data to run the experiments described in the paper, including:
- A README file with high-level documentation.
- A detailed description of the code structure, containing information about which folders correspond to code, benchmarks, data, …
- Provided detailed supported environments and hardware requirements.
- Provided compilation and running instructions, including scripts to download and build dependencies.
- Have scripts to plot the result and generate the figure.

I think this artifact has comprehensive documentation on how to set up the environment and run the experiment. The given artifact is functional.

#### Reproduced badge - assigned

The experiment in the artifact is a scaled-down version of the one in the paper. The result presented supports the major claim within an allowed tolerance. Thus I would suggest to assign the Reproduced badge.

### Recommendations:

There are also some recommendations:

- The artifact needs more details, for example, in the `Experiment (E1)`, `[Results]` part, adding the instruction to look for `README.md` in the `python` folder would be nice, etc.

- Some commands in the `python/README.md` might need adjustment. In `Fig. 6`, directly editing go.mod and executing `make install` doesn't work in clean environment. In `Figs. 13-15`, the command will return error, ‘/’ has to be added at the end of the path.
